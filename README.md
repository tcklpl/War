This is the browser version of a class-based war2-inspired game made using NodeJS, Typescript and WebGPU.

# Compiling

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your system. I'm currently using `node v20.12.2` and `npm 10.5.0`

To start the game in development mode (hot reload) you can do the following:

```
cd game
npm install
npm start
```

This will open a browser and start the react-scripts server in hot-reload mode: your changes will be reflected on the page as you save the files.

To start the server in development mode:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
