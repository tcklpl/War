# War Game

[Trello Page](https://trello.com/b/qBpWkPcw/war)

This is the browser version of a class-based war2-inspired game made using NodeJS, Typescript and WebGPU.

# Compiling

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your system. I'm currently using `node v16.17.1` and `npm 8.15.0`

The game is still in early development and the engine is currently being worked on. To start the game in development mode (hot reload) you can do the following:
```
cd game
npm install
npm start
```
This will open a browser and start the react-scripts server in hot-reload mode: your changes will be reflected on the page as you save the files.

To start the server in development mode:
```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Be sure to check out [game/README](./game/README.md), it will be updated as the development progresses.
