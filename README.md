# War Game

[Trello Page](https://trello.com/b/qBpWkPcw/war)

This is the browser version of a class-based war2-inspired game made using NodeJS, Typescript and WebGPU.

# Compiling

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your system. I'm currently using `node v16.17.1` and `npm 8.15.0`

For now the server is still a TODO and any files there are to be ignored. **there is no server for the time being**.

The game is still in early development and the engine is currently being worked on. To start the game in development mode (hot reload) you can do the following:
````
cd game
npm install
npm start
````
This will open a browser and start the react-scripts server in hot-reload mode: your changes will be reflected on the page as you save the files.

Be sure to check out [game/README](./game/README.md), it will be updated as the development progresses.
