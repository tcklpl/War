        CRYPTOGRAPHY AND HASHING CONFIG

        Configure this file to setup your server.
        Each config group is labeled as either IMPORTANT or SECONDARY:
        [ IMPORTANT ]   You probably want to take a look at this lines as you'll likely change them.
        [ SECONDARY ]   These are configs that you'll probably not need to change, as they are auto-generated or already sane ones.

    /*
        [ SECONDARY ]
        RSA key and hashing configuration.
        If you change any of these values, you'll also need to delete the 'public.key' and 'private.key' files.
        The next time the server starts without those files, new ones will be generated based on this config.

        - "rsa_key_length" should be an exponent of 2 and not lower than 2048. For example: 2048, 4096, 8192 etc.
          Notice that bigger key lengths will take more time and processing power to generate and sign stuff, 2048 is good enough;

        - "rsa_algorithm" NEEDS TO BE one of the following:
            - RS256
            - RS384
            - RS512
