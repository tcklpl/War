     * The buffer construction is delegated to the bufferView class.
     * Why? Because while it's valid to just load the buffer in memory and reference it as both
     * ARRAY_BUFFER and ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER (for indices) the documentation strongly advises
     * against it. As stated on the ARB_vertex_buffer_object externsion spec:
     *
     *  Should this extension include support for allowing vertex indices
     *  to be stored in buffer objects?
     *
     *  RESOLVED: YES.  It is easily and cleanly added with just the
     *  addition of a binding point for the index buffer object.  Since
     *  our approach of overloading pointers works for any pointer in GL,
     *  no additional APIs need be defined, unlike in the various *_element_array extensions.
     *
     *  Note that it is expected that implementations may have different
     *  memory type requirements for efficient storage of indices and
     *  vertices.  For example, some systems may prefer indices in AGP
     *  memory and vertices in video memory, or vice versa; or, on
     *  systems where DMA of index data is not supported, index data must
     *  be stored in (cacheable) system memory for acceptable
     *  performance.  As a result, applications are strongly urged to
     *  put their models' vertex and index data in separate buffers, to
     *  assist drivers in choosing the most efficient locations.
     *
     * And as the bufferView class is the one that contains the information of what that
     * buffer range is supposed to represent, I decided to delegate the buffer construction
     * to the bufferView.
